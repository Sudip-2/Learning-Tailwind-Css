API authentication
It checks whether you are authorised to access the data .

Types of authentication 
1.No authentication:
Rate limit to stop abuse of API

2.Basic authentication:
In basic authentication, the client's credentials (username and password) are encoded using Base64 and then sent in the HTTP request's Authorization header.

3.Api key authorisation:
4.Token based authorisation:

What are authentication and authorization?
In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying 
what they have access to.
    Comparing these processes to a real-world example, when you go through security in an airport, you show your ID to authenticate 
your identity. Then, when you arrive at the gate, you present your boarding pass to the flight attendant, so they can authorize 
you to board your flight and allow access to the plane.

what is bearer token authentication? 
The client gives password and id to server , server generates a token a user then use that to autheticate himself.
Bearer token authentication is a type of HTTP authentication scheme where a client sends a security token, known as a bearer token, 
in the Authorization header of an HTTP request to access protected resources. This token is an opaque string, not intended to have
any meaning to clients using it, and is typically generated by an authentication server after a successful user authentication.

Definition of OAuth Protocol
OAuth is an open-standard authorization framework that enables applications to access resources on behalf of a user without
 sharing the userâ€™s password. It decouples authentication from authorization, allowing users to grant limited access to their data
 without exposing their credentials. Ex - When we login in instagram through google or facebook .
